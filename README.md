README
======

This repository provides the mobile application of Claroline Connect developed with [Nativescript](https://github.com/NativeScript/NativeScript) and [Angular 2](https://github.com/angular/angular). The application works with Android and iOS devices.

Requirements
------------

You can develop for iOS only on Mac OS X systems.
To be able to work with iOS devices and projects, you need Mac OS X Mavericks or later.

Installation
------------

I invite you to follow the instructions written by [Nativescript](https://docs.nativescript.org/start/quick-setup)
(for [Windows](https://docs.nativescript.org/start/ns-setup-win), [OS X](https://docs.nativescript.org/start/ns-setup-os-x) and [Linux](https://docs.nativescript.org/start/ns-setup-linux)). Once everything is set up, run this command line:

    tns doctor

It will tell you if everything is alright for your installation

Usage
-----------

The easiest way to run the application is with [Genymotion](https://www.genymotion.com/). 
Once it is done, all you have to do is run this command line:

    tns run android

or 

    tns run ios

These command lines allow you to build the .apk file (Android) and the .ipa file (iOS) and they also work when you plug your phone to the computer.

The first time you launch the application, it will ask you to enter a url. Enter this one :

        http://dat.claroline.com

Then, you'll have to enter a username and a password :

        username : captain_america
        password : avengers
